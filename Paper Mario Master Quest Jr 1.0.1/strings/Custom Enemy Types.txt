Giga Bowser[END]

1C-097
[STYLE:RIGHT]
It's Bowser's ultimate form![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]
His HP is massive and he can[BR]
use any attack he wants.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When he increases his power[BR]
with the Star Rod, our attacks[BR]
will be totally useless.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When that happens, you need[BR]
to use Star Beam to disrupt[BR]
the Star Rod's power![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He will attack repeatedly,[BR]
and if you try to use a Life[BR]
Shroom during his attack[BR]
it won't work![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's gonna take every trick[BR]
in the book to win this fight![BR]
[WAIT][END]

1C-098
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Spiked Paragoomba.[BR][PAUSE:A]
Well Mario, we might be in[BR]
trouble here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As you can see, he's wearing one[BR]
of those awesome spiky helmets.[BR]
That rules out my headbonk and[BR]
other jump attacks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But how else can we reach him?[BR]
Don't we have any other attacks[BR]
that can hit flying enemies?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And where can I get one of[BR]
those sweet spiky helmets?[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-085
Spiked Paragloomba[END]

1C-099
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Spiked Paragloomba.[BR][PAUSE:A]
Just when I thought these nasty[BR]
guys couldn't get worse![BR]

Boo[END]

1C-09A
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Boo.[BR][PAUSE:A]
Man, I thought these guys were[BR]
friendly, but I guess you could[BR]
say the same about Goombas.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Anyway, these guys go invisible[BR]
and launch sneak attacks from[BR]
the shadows. 
[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I don't think we can scare them[BR]
off or run away easily. Yup, I'd[BR]
say we're in for a real fright[PAUSE:18][BR]
-- get it?[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-087
Cherry Bob-omb[END]

1C-09B
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Cherry Bob-omb.[BR][PAUSE:A]
An advanced Bob-omb in[BR]
the Koopa Army.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These shiny red jerks have[BR]
some heavy artillery locked[BR]
away inside.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They somehow found a way to[BR]
pack twice the firepower into[BR]
the same tiny body.[BR]
Technology, amirite?[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-088
Malpractice Guy[END]

1C-09C
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Malpractice Guy.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They're Medi Guys who trained[BR]
in causing diseases, not just[BR]
curing them.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their attacks will poison us,[BR]
and their hovercar is immune[BR]
to being shocked by the likes[BR]
of a Volt Shroom.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder if they have even[BR]
been to a real med school.[BR]
[PAUSE:10]I bet they haven't.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-08A
Chuff Puff[END]

1C-09E
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Chuff Puff.[BR][PAUSE:A]
Nasty creatures that are drawn[BR]
to hot environments.[BR]
Like a volcano.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their bodies are actually steam,[BR]
so water attacks are useless.[BR]
They're also immune to fire.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Shoot! I thought if we had[BR]
water attacks this place[BR]
would be a breeze![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They'll try and smother you[BR]
with their attack, so try[BR]
to guard well![BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-010
Bristle[END]

22-011
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Bristle.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They're large rock creatures[BR]
as old as time.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Immune to fire and explosion,[BR]
and covered in spikes. At least[BR]
its HP isn't that impressive.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I've read somewhere that the[BR]
underside isn't as hard, but[BR]
there doesn't seem to be a[BR]
way to flip them.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I bet they wouldn't do so[BR]
hot if you nailed 'em with[BR]
an earthquake from below.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The worst part is that they[BR]
can even hit us through Lady[BR]
Bow's special ability.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Even then, there's no way[BR]
around it. These guys will[BR]
do one final dash before[BR]
they die.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Bowser must have supplied them[BR]
to Tubba Blubba to increase[BR]
security at the castle.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-012
Dark Bristle[END]

22-013
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Dark Bristle.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They're large rock creatures[BR]
older than time itself.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Immune to fire and explosion,[BR]
and covered in spikes. I hope[BR]
you have a plan, Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Just like the normal Bristle,[BR]
these guys are weak to being[BR]
struck from below.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They won't feel so good if[BR]
you nailed 'em with a quake[BR]
from below.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Don't try and hide, these guys[BR]
can hit us no matter where we[BR]
hide. They do a final dash[BR]
attack as well.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Bowser really found himself a[BR]
dangerous ally with Dark[BR]
Bristles.[PAUSE:A] Could it get worse?[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-08D
Pinkzee Dayzee[END]

1C-101
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Pinkzee Dayzee.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They're called that[BR]
because they're pink.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their song is so soothing[BR]
it heals our enemies![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Boy, I wish they would heal[BR]
us instead. I'm getting tired[BR]
of fighting all these guys![BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-08E
Conflagrare[END]

1C-102
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Conflagrare.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They're apparently flame[BR]
creatures, like Embers.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The heat is so intense, it'll[BR]
cause your defense to drop way[BR]
down when the ram into you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
After a few hits of that,[BR]
their fireball attack will[BR]
hurt a lot! Let's be very[BR]
careful, okay?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Just like their blue brethren[BR]
they split when we attack them[BR]
and have loads of HP.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If we don't think out a[BR]
plan of attack, we'll be[BR]
surrounded![BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-08F
Iron Pokey[END]

1C-103
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is an Iron Pokey.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They're Pokeys that have[BR]
some sort of iron coating.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They seem to be pretty outdated[BR]
though, so I bet they aren't[BR]
as tough as they look.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A good shock should give them[BR]
a bad day. You could also try[BR]
water, but no promises on[BR]
that one.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-094
007 Guy[END]

1C-108
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a 007 Guy.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A seriously blacked-out[BR]
camo Shy Guy. Also known as[BR]
James Bond Guy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're fitted with some light[BR]
combat armor and swing their[BR]
hammers with extreme prejudice.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their aim with a slingshot is[BR]
perfect. They will hit you[BR]
no matter where or how you hide.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
So I guess you have to decide[BR]
which is worse; hammer or[BR]
slingshot?[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-095
Dandy Guy[END]

1C-109
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Dandy Guy.[BR][PAUSE:A]
What a spiffy looking guy! Too[BR]
bad they're super evil.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They make you dizzy with their[BR]
dancing, or they might do a[BR]
triple kick in your face.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There's no way to tell, so try[BR]
to prepare for the kick, since[BR]
the startup is the same.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're elite dancers, but their[BR]
real claim to fame is the outfits.[BR]
[PAUSE:A]Or maybe that's just my opinion.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-096
Bigoomba[END]

1C-10A
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Bigoomba.[BR][PAUSE:A]
Pretty large for a Goomba but[BR]
not as big as King Goomba.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They are much stronger than[BR]
a normal goomba, boasting[BR]
much more HP.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But I'm not a normal goomba,[BR]
so you just leave it to me![BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-097
Red Paragoomba[END]

1C-10B
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Red Paragoomba.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They're faster, stronger,[BR]
and more tenacious than normal[BR]
Paragoombas.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They'll attack you twice,[BR]
so don't let your guard down![BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-099
Red Goomba[END]

This is a Red Goomba.[BR][PAUSE:A]

[WAIT][END]

29-09D
Purple Spiny[END]

1C-111
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Purple Spiny.[BR][PAUSE:A]
It seems like it's just a weaker[BR]
Spiny.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you haven't noticed, they're[BR]
also purple.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their underbellies are reinforced[BR]
so flipping them doesn't put them[BR]
in as much danger.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Still, they're not that tough. You[BR]
could whoop these guys across the[BR]
Mushroom Kingdom and back.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-09E
Cosmic Cleft[END]

1C-112
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Cosmic Cleft.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A Cleft that came from outer[BR]
space. [PAUSE:0F]I think.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They have really tough defense,[BR]
and star attacks won't[BR]
work on 'em![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If their eyes get loopy and they[BR]
start to glow, better get out of[BR]
the way. The pain train is coming.[BR]
[PAUSE:10]Choo.[PAUSE:10] Choo.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-09F
Electro Piranha[END]

1C-113
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is an Electro Piranha.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A Piranha Plant with electricity[BR]
coursing through its...[PAUSE:10]xylem?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They are still plants though, so[BR]
if you have a fire flower handy,[BR]
now is the time to use it![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their attack will paralyze you,[BR]
so you had better block it.[BR]
You could try avoiding it, as well.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-106
Raphael the Raven[END]

1C-120
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is Raphael the Raven.[BR][PAUSE:A]
He's guardian of Jade Jungle.[BR]
He's also a tough fighter.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When he gets low on HP, his[BR]
temper flares up. He will[BR]
give it all he's got at that[BR]
point.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I get the feeling he really[BR]
cares about his fellow Ravens.[BR]
He didn't ask them to fight.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Maybe they just don't have[BR]
enough sprites to fight.[BR]
That's probably it, actually.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-107
Blue Spike Top[END]

1C-121
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Blue Spike Top.[BR][PAUSE:A]
It's just a Spike Top that is[BR]
blue, and has beefier stats.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They hit pretty hard though,[BR]
so maybe shrinking 'em is[BR]
a good idea.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their defense is so rugged that[BR]
I'm not sure anything could[BR]
hurt them![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Even flipped, they have more[BR]
defense than a lot of enemies.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you have a Thunder Bolt or[BR]
Thunder Rage laying around,[BR]
now is a good time to use it![BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-108
Illusion[END]

1C-122
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is an Illusion.[BR][PAUSE:A]
It's just a figment of our[BR]
imagination, but it can still[BR]
fight.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I have no idea how it works,[BR]
but I guess after 99 floors[BR]
in this place our psyche is[BR]
going to suffer.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I have no idea how an illusion[BR]
would go about attacking us.[BR]
Keep your guard up at all[BR]
costs![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This pit is a pain, messing[BR]
with our minds like this. It[BR]
picked the wrong dude to[BR]
mess with this time![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This is the final test, Mario![BR]
We just have to win this and[BR]
we can go home![BR]

29-111
Dark Boo[END]

1C-125
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Dark Boo.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A very dangerous Boo that[BR]
loves dark places. Like the[BR]
bottom of an ancient tomb.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They have relatively low attack,[BR]
but they are hard to block.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their HP is pretty high, and[BR]
they always start a fight[BR]
invisible.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We are in for a long fight, I hope[BR]
we can heal off the damage they[BR]
do. Maybe we should bring more[BR]
items next time.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

2F-035
Bandito Elito[END]

2F-036
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Bandito Elito.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They are the big bosses[BR]
of highway robbery.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These guys attack with an[BR]
odd pause. It can be tough[BR]
to read their attacks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They do some decent damage[BR]
and take away our abilities[BR]
instead of our money![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They have loads of HP so let's[BR]
hit 'em with everything we've[BR]
got![BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-000
Dark Koopatrol[END]

22-001
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Dark Koopatrol.[BR][PAUSE:A]
The Elite of the Elite.[BR]
Unbelievable that there could[BR]
be such a nasty foe.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These guys don't call for help,[BR]
and they don't need it. They[BR]
can take you down all by[BR]
themselves.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Be careful of their attack,[BR]
if you don't block it you'll[BR]
lose one of your abilities.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They have other nasty tricks[BR]
so take them seriously![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They are overworked like the[BR]
normal Koopatrol, so use that[BR]
to your advantage.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-002
Disastar[END]

22-003
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is Disastar.[BR][PAUSE:A]
The powerful guard of this[BR]
ancient tomb.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Apparently it was made[BR]
by the Star Rod itself![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It must have been created to[BR]
destroy anyone who dared[BR]
enter this tomb, and keep[BR]
the secrets inside safe.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It really doesn't look that[BR]
strong. Do you think being[BR]
stuck down here forever[BR]
made it weaken?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I really hope you are ready[BR]
for this fight. I don't know[BR]
what to expect.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-004
Dark Bones[END]

22-005
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Dark Bones.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A petrified Dry Bones that[BR]
has been rotting for ages.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They have crazy defenses and[BR]
attack, but almost no HP.[BR]
Sounds easy enough.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There seems to be no way to[BR]
truly defeat them, however.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
No matter how much they fall,[BR]
they get right back up! Even[BR]
explosions and fire will do[BR]
nothing.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If they sense your HP is low,[BR]
they will get up faster.[BR]
You need to stay healthy if[BR]
you want to beat them![BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-006
Golden Cleft[END]

22-007
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Golden Cleft.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A Cleft with a brilliant[BR]
golden shine. Imagine if[BR]
there was a light source![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their solid bodies are quite[BR]
tough. They won't even flinch[BR]
from most attacks, and quakes[BR]
will have no effect.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When they get loopy-eyed, it's[BR]
time to get out of the way. You[BR]
won't want to take that hit.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The thing with these guys is[BR]
they can stall for a bit longer[BR]
than other enemies that charge.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You should take note of their[BR]
HP. Once it falls below a[BR]
certain point, they won't[BR]
stall anymore.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Knowing when to take evasive[BR]
action is the key to beating[BR]
these guys![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They expend a lot of energy[BR]
to attack, so they must be[BR]
quite tired.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-008
Golden Goomba[END]

22-009
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Golden Goomba.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A Goomba with a brilliant[BR]
golden shine. Imagine if[BR]
there was a light source![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These guys wear a thin[BR]
layer of golden armor.[BR]
They also attack in a dual[BR]
strike pattern.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When I get a job I'm totally[BR]
gonna buy me some gold armor.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How much do you think it[BR]
would cost? Probably more[BR]
than I'll make in my lifetime.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I remember reading that gold[BR]
conducts electricity very well,[BR]
do you think paralysis works?[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-00A
Golden Chomp[END]

22-00B

This is a Golden Chomp.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A Chomp with a brilliant[BR]
golden shine. Imagine if[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
They have high defense and[BR]
attack, and decent HP.[BR]
Very well rounded guys, huh?[BR]
Get it?[PAUSE:0A] Just laugh for once...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Usually these beefy enemies[BR]
are weak to shrink. I get the[BR]
feeling they are weak to[BR]
something else though.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Be careful of their attack,[BR]
sometimes they will fake you out.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
No matter how you slice it,[BR]
these guys are one of the[BR]
toughest [PAUSE:0A]AROUND.[PAUSE:0A][BR]
Ha, I'm so funny![BR]

This is a Golden Puff.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A Puff with a brilliant[BR]
golden shine. Imagine if[BR]
there was a light source![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These puffs seem to be[BR]
made of dust, gold dust[BR]
specifically.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I bet my mom wouldn't make[BR]
me dust the house if it[BR]
were made of these guys.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Though I guess the frequent[BR]
lightning strikes in the[BR]
house would get old quick.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh yeah, these guys can fire[BR]
off lightning bolts without[BR]
needing to charge.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You would think as a flying[BR]
enemy they are weak to dizzy.[BR]
It seems like it might be[BR]
something else this time.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

29-101
Inferno Guy[END]

1C-115
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is an Inferno Guy.[BR][PAUSE:A]
An elite warrior that cloaks[BR]
himself in a white fire.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It burns intensely, but it's[BR]
still fire, so water should[BR]
do the trick.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These hotheads do some extreme[BR]
damage! Better work 'em over[BR]
before they bring the heat.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Say, what do you think the gold[BR]
color in the fire is? Is their[BR]
fire just that special?[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-00E
Kamek[END]

22-00F
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is Kamek.[BR][PAUSE:A]
This old Koopa must be going[BR]
senile if he thinks he can[BR]
take us on![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I mean, he isn't even as strong[BR]
as a normal Magikoopa, thanks[BR]
to how old he is.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, it might be something else[BR]
too. He looks like he skipped[BR]
lunch.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Whatever the case, he has low[BR]
HP compared to others of his[BR]
class so we should be grateful.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-014
Lakilulu[END]

22-015
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is Lakilulu.[BR][PAUSE:A]
She is Spike's girlfriend.[BR]
There was no hesitation[BR]
to stick up for him.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That must be what love is.[BR]
How did a loser like Spike[BR]
get such a nice lady to[BR]
go out with him?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
She seems to be pretty strong[BR]
too. Say, you think she will[BR]
join our party?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We could use the extra muscle[BR]
if we are going to fight[BR]
Bowser in the end.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Whatever the case, we have to[BR]
beat her if we want to keep[BR]
moving. I'm sure she will[BR]
understand.[BR]

This is a Bob-oom.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They're Bob-ombs that have[BR]
gained elite status in the[BR]
Koopa Army.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're packed with three[BR]
times the explosives as a[BR]
normal Bob-omb.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
After a couple turns, they'll[BR]
ignite and attack on the[BR]
same turn. So we can't just[BR]
ignore them![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They don't have the same[BR]
weaknesses as the other[BR]
Bob-ombs, but attacking[BR]
while they're ignited works.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Let's blow 'em up while they[BR]
are nice and safely not in[BR]
our faces, okay?[BR]

This is a Practitioner Guy.[BR][PAUSE:A]
An advanced Medi Guy who[BR]
boasts better healing, damage,[BR]
and a tougher hovercar.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That snazzy new hovercar[BR]
doesn't conduct electricity,[BR]
so their attacks won't get[BR]
interrupted by shocks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He has some decent defense for[BR]
a flying enemy. Doing lots of[BR]
damage won't be easy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Fortunately their HP isn't[BR]
high, since it's just a Shy Guy[BR]
up there. A good heavy hit will[BR]
take him out.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As with all of these guys, they[BR]
really don't like getting dizzy.[BR]
It must have something to do[BR]
with how they float.[BR]

What do you say we just take[BR]
'em out with one heavy blow[BR]
instead, okay?[BR]

It isn't a massive improvement,[BR]
but sometimes slight changes can[BR]
make or break a battle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As with all of these guys, they[BR]
really don't like getting dizzy.[BR]
Must be the weird way they[BR]
float in the air.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Let's keep 'em all loopy while[BR]
we take care of the rest of our[BR]
enemies, okay?[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-020
Ztar[END]

22-021
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Ztar.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A fake star that Bowser[BR]
created.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They can grant small wishes,[BR]
and use this power to buff[BR]
enemy attack and defense.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Besides being immune to all[BR]
status and a number of elements,[BR]
they do some decent damage.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Bowser really stepped up[BR]
security these days hasn't he?[BR]
Remember when this was easy?[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-022
Ice Koopa[END]

22-023
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is an Ice Koopa.[BR][PAUSE:A]
Pretty self explanatory,[BR]
don't you think?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're solid all the way through[BR]
so flipping them only goes so far.[BR]
Their defense won't go down.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You need to be careful of the[BR]
way they attack, their slippery[BR]
shells mean their speed varies.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their ice-cold bodies will also[BR]
freeze you, so take care to[BR]
block. Or take 'em out before[BR]
they attack you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It does beg the question, how[BR]
can a Koopa survive in this[BR]
climate? Aren't they cold[BR]
blooded?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I asked Kooper and he said I[BR]
was being narrow minded. Can you[BR]
believe that!?[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-024
Spacee Dayzee[END]

22-025
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Spacee Dayzee.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A Dayzee that loves to stare[BR]
into outer space.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Apparently they are longing to[BR]
return to their cosmic homes.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They sing in the night, calling[BR]
to their families. They're not[BR]
bad singers, either.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their song will hurt, and also[BR]
raise the attack and defense[BR]
of all enemies.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These Dayzees are also immune[BR]
to cosmic attacks, but I think[BR]
fire could do some damage.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-026
Rogue Star[END]

22-027
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Rogue Star.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A Star Kid who decided to[BR]
join Bowser.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You wouldn't think any of the[BR]
Star Kids could be so stupid![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But I guess that's kids for you.[BR]
They're so impressionable, it's[BR]
actually kind of sad.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They have to look up how, but[BR]
they can grant small wishes.[BR]
They use this power to buff[BR]
enemy attack and defense.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Bowser seems to be working the[BR]
kids pretty hard, they look like[BR]
they need a nap.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Normally I would say take it[BR]
easy on 'em, but they're[BR]
so dangerous we really can't.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Being Stars, they are immune[BR]
to quite a number of elements.[BR]
You'll just have to beat 'em[BR]
the old fashioned way![BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-028
Koopa Koot[END]

22-029
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is Koopa Koot.[BR][PAUSE:A]
This old guy really wants[BR]
to fight?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Back in the day he may have[BR]
been tough but he can't be that[BR]
strong now.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When he starts talking, his[BR]
long-winded stories make it[BR]
hard to stay awake.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Look how old he is! He can barely[BR]
stand up. Let's go easy on him,[BR]
okay Mario?[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-02A
Bandito[END]

22-02B
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Bandito.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They're faster than a normal[BR]
Bandit, and they won't wait[BR]
around with your money.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Seriously, if these guys take[BR]
your coins you won't see 'em[BR]
again. At least they don't take[BR]
as many as normal Bandits.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These sneaky devils are often[BR]
transparent, meaning you'll[BR]
have to avoid at least one[BR]
attack from them.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They are also blue, if you haven't[BR]
noticed. Not as blue as you'll be[BR]
if they take off with all your[BR]
money though![BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-02C
White Ninjakoopa[END]

22-02D
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a White Ninjakoopa.[BR][PAUSE:A]
I don't think he is a brother[BR]
to the others, but he seems to[BR]
want to prove his worth to them.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He's almost as strong as they[BR]
are, but that isn't really[BR]
saying much.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They practice ninja skills,[BR]
so if he jumps, be careful[BR]
he doesn't sneak up on us.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He also buffs his allies defense.[BR]
That could be bad for us! We[BR]
need to take this guy out fast![BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-02E
Lakiwun[END]

22-02F
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Lakiwun.[BR][PAUSE:A]
It seems like it's just a weaker[BR]
Lakitu. [PAUSE:0F] Oh I get it;[BR]
Lakiwun, Lakitu.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Whoever named these isn't very[BR]
creative. I wonder who names[BR]
these guys. Probably some high[BR]
end royalty somewhere.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He throws Purple Spinies, and as[BR]
you can guess, they look like[BR]
Spinies, but purple.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Lakiwun are known for their HP,[BR]
but I bet they get dizzy easy the[BR]
way they float like that.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-030
Red Clubba[END]

22-031
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Red Clubba.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A stronger, faster, uglier[BR]
Clubba. [PAUSE:0F]What? I'm not a fan of[BR]
red.[PAUSE:0F] No offense.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These guys pack a punch, so[BR]
take 'em out fast. Don't[BR]
be afraid to use items or[BR]
some of that FP.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you need to, running is an[BR]
option as well. Better to get[BR]
out alive than try and be[BR]
a hero![BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-032
???[END]

22-033
[STYLE:RIGHT]
I[PAUSE:A].[PAUSE:A].[PAUSE:A].[PAUSE:A]actually have no idea who[BR]
or what this is. It resembles[BR]
a Shy Guy a bit.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I don't know what to expect[BR]
from this thing.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I get the feeling there's[BR]
more going on here than meets[BR]
the eye.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If things go bad maybe we[BR]
should try a new approach.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A little fancy dodging early,[BR]
then for the final stretch[BR]
hit him with everything[BR]
you've got![BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-034
Bzzrk![END]

22-035
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Bzzrk![BR][PAUSE:A]
Nasty cousins to the common[BR]
Bzzap![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Is the "!" part of the name?[PAUSE:0A][BR]
How do you even pronounce that,[BR]
do you just yell?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The first person to find[BR]
these creatures must've yelled[BR]
from the painful sting.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Speaking of, that sting is[BR]
one of the most painful[BR]
attacks out there.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:10]Maybe we should be careful[BR]
and take them out first.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-036
Bloober[END]

22-037
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Bloober.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They look identical to Bloopers.[BR]
[PAUSE:F]Besides being pink.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That pink color isn't to look[BR]
pretty, it's probably because[BR]
of the waters these creatures[BR]
call home.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Of course, it could be something[BR]
else. These guys aren't your[BR]
average enemy, their HP is huge![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Be careful, Mario! I want to[BR]
make it back home alive, not[BR]
end up in a Bloober belly![BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-038
Dry Bubble[END]

22-039
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Dry Bubble.[BR][PAUSE:A]
They're hot burning creatures[BR]
that thrive in desert climates.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They don't have too much HP, but[BR]
you can't get a good jump on[BR]
'em without feeling the heat.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You could give 'em a good[BR]
what-for with your hammer, but[BR]
they like to sit up high.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're so shiny though, I...[BR]
[PAUSE:20]Man, I think the heat is[BR]
making me delusional.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-03A
Dull Bones[END]

22-03B
[STYLE:RIGHT]
This is a Dull Bones.[BR][PAUSE:A]
A pretty crusty looking guy, if[BR]
you ask me.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're pretty durable, though a[BR]
good explosion should take 'em[BR]
down for good.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're immune to fire though,[BR]
so take care not to waste[BR]
precious time on a fire flower.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you knock 'em down, they[BR]
will get back up and attack[BR]
right away.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They seem to stay down if you[BR]
just keep hitting them though.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

22-03C
The Master[END]

22-03D
[STYLE:RIGHT]He is The Master.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He owns the Dojo-- [BR]
and he's the strongest member.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Though you'd hardly recognize[BR]
him now! Look at that crazy[BR]
hair![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Say, what do you think keeps[BR]
his hair in place? I bet he[BR]
goes through a ton of hair[BR]
product to get that style.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This is a whole new look, and[BR]
with it a new fighting style.[BR]
It doesn't look like he'll use[BR]
the same tricks as before.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A lifetime of training has[BR]
given him the ability to strike[BR]
us no matter where we hide.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Many years of training in Star[BR]
Haven with Koopa Koot and my[BR]
grandpa have given him the[BR]
ability to drain Star Energy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Upkeeping such a powerful[BR]
presence must be exhausting. I[BR]
think the fatigue might end[BR]
up getting to him.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess we just have to face[BR]
the music, this guy is going to[BR]
be our greatest challenge.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm with you no matter what,[BR]
so let's give it our very best[BR]
against the full power of the[BR]
Mafia's greatest fighter![BR]
[WAIT][END]
