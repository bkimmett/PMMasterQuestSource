03-046
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hm? Who's it from?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hmmmmm...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, my granddaughter, Donlee![BR]
She recently entered the[BR]
family business.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Umph... [PAUSE:08]Is that so?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, I see. Interesting...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
She opened up her business[BR]
at Dry Dry Outpost, deep in[BR]
the desert.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's located somewhere[BR]
quiet off the main drag.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
She seems to be keeping busy.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]That's good to hear.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Thanks so much for bringing[BR]
this letter.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'll give you this.[WAIT][END]

03-048
[STYLE:RIGHT]Nice to meet you.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I come from {Color:20}Starborn Valley{Color:0A}.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Starborn Valley is in the[BR]
Shiver region, a chill place[BR]
far to the north, at the very[BR]
end of the earth.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Donle, who hails from there,[BR]
said that he had something[BR]
important to tell you, Mario.[WAIT][END]

03-049
[STYLE:RIGHT]Donle of Starborn Valley is[BR]
my son, Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It seems he's calling for you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If he is searching for you,[BR]
you can be sure something[BR]
important is going down.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You must go to Starborn Valley![BR]
Shake a leg![WAIT][END]

03-04A
[STYLE:RIGHT]Yes, please hurry![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I will run ahead and take[BR]
tidings of you to Donle.[WAIT][END]

03-054
[STYLE:RIGHT]Most of all, though, you shouldn't[BR]
go ask the Mafia for help.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That would be really bad news[BR]
for us...I mean, for you![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Don't even think about it![WAIT][END]

03-07C
[STYLE:RIGHT]The building with the spinning[BR]
roof is Donlon's house.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He's scary. He also happens[BR]
to be as stubborn as a mule.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]He rarely comes out.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As scary as he is, though,[BR]
his connections are no joke.[BR]
He knows just about everything.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He did a shakedown just the[BR]
other day! I'm glad I'm not[BR]
that guy![WAIT][END]

03-07D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh... Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:05]Donlon was looking for you.[BR]
He lives in that house with[BR]
the spinning roof.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He asked me to tell you to go[BR]
meet him at his house.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I was just about to go look[BR]
for you, but here you are![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's rare for Donlon to call[BR]
somebody over to his house...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He's a bit shady.[BR]
Even when he has visitors,[BR]
it's rare for him to come out[BR]
of the house at all.[WAIT][END]

03-089
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Great timing.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Somebody was looking for you.[BR]
He's over at Donlon's house.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Up on Shooting Star Summit,[BR]
there are these two siblings[BR]
named Donluvlee and Donlow.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Donluvlee sells information.[BR]
Her contacts are good at finding[BR]
Badges or Star Pieces.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When you take Star Pieces[BR]
to Donlow, he'll trade them[BR]
for Badges.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These two could help you, no?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]You ought to go meet them.[WAIT][END]

Star Summit, right? Did you[BR]
meet Donluvlee and Donlow?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I hear that Donluvlee uses[BR]
some shady connections to find[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Her little brother, Donlow?[BR]
He's crazy about Star Pieces.[BR]
Trades Badges for 'em.[WAIT][END]

03-074
[STYLE:RIGHT]Bub-ulbs come from a[BR]
flower-filled land called[BR]
{Color:20}Flower Fields{Color:0A}.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They say the flowers in[BR]
Flower Fields are in trouble![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
To get to Flower Fields, you[BR]
need four kinds of seeds that[BR]
only Bub-ulbs possess.[BR]
But where are the Bub-ulbs?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Please, Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]you must look for Bub-ulbs[BR]
and get the seeds from them![BR]
[WAIT][END]

06-067
[STYLE:RIGHT]Whenever I have problems, I take[BR]
a brief journey across town to[BR]
see Donlon. He sells information.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He's an old mobster, you know. A[BR]
bit unusual, perhaps, but his[BR]
most people think he is in the[BR]
"Waste Management" business.[WAIT][END]

12-03A
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Did you reach Starborn Valley?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Did you see Donle?[BR]
[PAUSE:14][WAIT][NEXT]
... Oh, excellent. He said what?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]An item that has been passed[BR]
down in this city?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Um... Oh, right! There was[BR]
something like that.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Just a minute,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I think I've got it somewhere.[WAIT][END]

12-03C
[STYLE:RIGHT]This Bucket has been passed[BR]
down through the years in[BR]
Shiver City.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As Donle must have told you, [BR]
there's a legend associated with[BR]
it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you use this and the Scarf[BR]
together, the way to the Crystal[BR]
Palace will open.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Who knows what all that means,[BR]
though! Ha ha ha![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I don't have the slightest clue[BR]
as to how to use them together.[WAIT][END]

12-0EA
[STYLE:RIGHT]How do you do?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm called Donle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I care for the Star Kids born[BR]
here in Starborn Valley.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There are many things I must[BR]
tell you...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...but not here. Come, let's go to[BR]
my house.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I cannot concentrate out here in[BR]
the cold.[WAIT][END]

12-0F0
[STYLE:RIGHT]I sent a Ninji to my father,[BR]
Donlon, hoping that I could coax[BR]
you to come here...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Because I have found out where[BR]
the last Star Spirit is.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I shook down a very cold child[BR]
wearing what looked like an egg.[BR]
He heard about it from some of[BR]
Bowser's goons.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If he's as much a rat as he[BR]
seems, the last Star Spirit is[BR]
held atop Shiver Mountain,[BR]
which lies to the north.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Up top sits the {Color:20}Crystal Palace{Color:0A}.[BR]
The Star Spirit waits there.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The Crystal Palace was originally[BR]
built to honor the Stars...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But as time passed, it slowly [BR]
faded from the memories of local[BR]
people...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...and now, no one can remember[BR]
how to reach the palace.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There is a way, though, and it[BR]
involves items that have been[BR]
passed down in these lands.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Here, take this.[WAIT][END]

12-0F5
[STYLE:RIGHT]That egg-wearing rat told me[BR]
that a Star Spirit waits in[BR]
Crystal Palace.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]Please, you must save him![WAIT][END]

12-0F6
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You have saved the last[BR]
imprisoned Star Spirit![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I heard all about your triumph.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now, finally, it is time to take[BR]
back the Star Rod.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]...the fate of the Stars rests[BR]
squarely on your shoulders.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Shake down Bowser for us all![WAIT][END]

12-0FA
[STYLE:RIGHT]Along with the Ninjis, we're[BR]
taking care of the Star Kids[BR]
[PAUSE:05]under the instruction of the[BR]
waste management guru, Donle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's very rewarding to think[BR]
that one of these kids might[BR]
grow up to be a Star Spirit![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, can you imagine it? What a[BR]
happy day that'd be...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But unless things get better[BR]
around here, it'll just be a[BR]
fantasy that never comes true.[WAIT][END]

12-134
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Faded:D9}My name is Donlar.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I am the true "Don".[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm not really here, this is a[BR]
vision. That last shroom you ate[BR]
was rigged with a drug.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Right now you should be seeing[BR]
-and hearing- just what the[BR]
Mushroom Mafia wants.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]Crystal Palace is the home[BR]
base of the "Don" family Mafia.[WAIT][END]

12-135
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Faded:D9}We have little time to waste, so[BR]
listen carefully.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You may not know this, but the[BR]
followers of Bowser have invaded[BR]
Crystal Palace, where stars are[BR]
honored.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now, what I have to tell you is[BR]
very important.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Listen to every word I say![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can't tell you the whole tale.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]In the interest of time I'll be[BR]
brief, so pay attention to the[BR]
key points.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The story begins a long, long[BR]
time ago...[BR]

I was just a goomah back[BR]

The answer was "King Bowser."[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]The bridge to Koopa Village[BR]
is out? My associates know[BR]
of a switch in a nearby tree.[WAIT][END]

21-002
[STYLE:RIGHT]I see...Koopas are in trouble.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You need to find and help the[BR]
Koopa with a Blue Shell.[WAIT][END]

21-003
[STYLE:RIGHT]Head over to the east. To the[BR]
stone fortress at the end of[BR]
Pleasant Path, to the east[BR]
of Toad Town[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It is a long journey east, even[BR]
from Koopa Village, and the road[BR]
is full of enemies.[WAIT][END]

21-004
[STYLE:RIGHT]The stone fortress is locked,[BR]
and it's guarded by Koopas.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
My inside guy tells me there's[BR]
A pink tomboy with an explosive[BR]
personality locked up there.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You help her escape,[BR]

Your blue-shelled Koopa and[BR]
explosive Bob-omb are the keys[BR]

Move with haste now.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The Star Spirit has many[BR]
important things to tell you.[WAIT][END]

21-006
[STYLE:RIGHT]You go to the south of Toad Town[BR]
and you'll find a station that is[BR]
the departure point to where you[BR]
need to go.[WAIT][END]

21-007
[STYLE:RIGHT]The bridge is out, eh? Maybe[BR]
you should try getting help from[BR]
that nearby paratroopa.[WAIT][END]

21-008
[STYLE:RIGHT]Now, make your way through the[BR]
desert at the end of the[BR]
mountain path.[WAIT][END]

21-009
[STYLE:RIGHT]At the end of the path in the[BR]

It is there where you will find[BR]
some answers you seek.[WAIT][END]

21-00A
[STYLE:RIGHT]You should talk to one of my[BR]
associates, a Nomadimouse that[BR]
lives in Dry-Dry-Outpost.[WAIT][END]

21-00B
[STYLE:RIGHT]My associate is pretty picky[BR]
and only likes lemons. Give him[BR]
one of those, he should tell you[BR]
everything you need to know.[WAIT][END]

21-00C
[STYLE:RIGHT]My associate is not who you think[BR]
he is. Head up to the rooftops by[BR]

21-011

Forever Forest, [PAUSE:05]you'll find a[BR]

21-012
[STYLE:RIGHT]In the shadowy Forever Forest,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]you must take the right path to[BR]
get out.[BR]

the chandelier.[BR]

Yeah, thats how you gotta do it,[BR]
its simple, really.[WAIT][END]

the citizens of Toad Town.[BR]

Walk west from the southern[BR]

You should turn invisible to[BR]

21-01F
[STYLE:RIGHT]You need to go into the house[BR]
you were literally just in.[BR]

Find a key and return to[BR]

Ain't nothin' sweeter than cake.[BR]

Tayce. T makes some good cake[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sure you know what item[BR]
to give her. It's painfully[BR]
obvious.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

21-025
[STYLE:RIGHT]You'll hit a dead end on the[BR]
moving walkways of the Toy Box.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Instead of trying to jump over,[BR]
turn invisible and slip[BR]
through the net.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Soon enough you'll reach some[BR]
blocks that move up and down[BR]
but you cannot jump over.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Jump to a high spot near[BR]
the platform and hitch a ride[BR]
with a Paratroopa.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You should give the dictionary[BR]
back to the scholarly Toad.[BR]
With it, he can decipher[BR]
the Shy Guy's language.[WAIT][END]

21-026
[STYLE:RIGHT]The path you choose might[BR]

[STYLE:RIGHT]When in doubt, smash it[BR]

Jump on it and smash down[BR]

[PAUSE:08]{StartFX:Shrinking}{StartFX:Jitter}No--------!![BR]
{EndFX:Jitter}{EndFX:Shrinking}[WAIT][NEXT]
This is from that ghost![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It says, "I'll creep up on you[BR]
while you're sleeping... Boo!"[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
{StartFX:Jitter}{EndFX:FadedNoise:28}He loves scaring me![BR]
[PAUSE:14][WAIT][NEXT]
You think...he'll really...?[BR]
Creeping...darkness...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, woe is me! I'll never sleep...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
{EndFX:Jitter}Get a hold of yourself, Fice T.![BR]
Stand tall! Fear not![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'll be OK. Here, take this.[WAIT][END]

0E-021
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Ha ha! Yeah, that's right![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Let's see how you like the new,[BR]
improved Jr. Troopa![WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Hmmm![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Noble Mario![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You have bested me, The Master,[BR]
the strongest of fighters![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The pride of my Dojo has been[BR]
soiled. I could not defeat you[BR]
without endangering the life[BR]
of my students.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I challenge you to one final[BR]
battle! One where we do not[BR]
hold back![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I don't expect you to accept[BR]
my challenge. You have already[BR]
proven your strength.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Never-the-less, take this[BR]
with respect.[BR]
[WAIT][END]

{StartFX:Shrinking}{StartFX:Jitter}Cough cough...[BR]
{EndFX:Shrinking}{EndFX:Jitter}[PAUSE:0A]Mario, you have already proven[BR]
yourself stronger than me.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Unless you intend to challenge[BR]
the results of my forbidden[BR]
training?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm afraid I cannot allow my[BR]
students to witness our final[BR]
battle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I lack experience with it, so[BR]
there is a good chance they[BR]
may get hurt in the fight.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you wish to try, please[BR]
meet me at the bottom of[BR]
Shooting Star Summit,[BR]
east of the Star Temple.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I must warn you that when I[BR]
go into that form I lose all[BR]
control.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You should assume it will be[BR]
a fight to the death. You may[BR]
wish to...[PAUSE:0A] keep on training[BR]
instead. Wheeze...[BR]
[WAIT][END]
